# UIC-Search-Engine
The software is designed in Python and all its functions have been modularized to allow for future expansion and use in further projects. In about two hours, the search engine retrieves, crawls, and preprocesses 3500 web pages from the UIC domain. 

The search engine can be launched immediately by running the python search_engine.py file on the terminal. 
However, individual python files are also provided to carry out web crawling and preprocessing.
